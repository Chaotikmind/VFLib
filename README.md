VFLib Copyright (C) 2008 by Vinnie Falco. http://github.com/vinniefalco/VFLib

This is my soon to be released project which is NOT QUITE READY FOR PUBLIC USE!
There's no documentation, no testing, and no support so unless you enjoy
banging your head repeatedly against the wall wait until the official release!
